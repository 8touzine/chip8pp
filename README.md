## Features

- Fully working CHIP-8 interpreter (tested with **Space Invaders**)
- Fetch, decode, and execute of all opcodes
- Keyboard input mapped to CHIP-8 hex keypad
- Graphics rendering using SDL2
- delay timers implemented (sound to be implemented)
- CPU cycle and main loop logic based on real CHIP-8 specs

> **ROM path is currently hardcoded in the source code.**
> To use another rom, renamed it to **current.ch8** and place it in /rom.  
> A future update may include a simple GUI or file selector to load `.ch8` ROMs manually.
